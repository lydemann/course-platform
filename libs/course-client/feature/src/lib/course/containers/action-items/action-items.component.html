    Congratulations on completing this week! As soon as you've finished watching
    all of the training videos in full please complete the action items below.
    This is an "implementation program" and to get results you must do the work.
    Completing the worksheets and uploading them to our action items storage
    system keeps all of your worksheets safe in one place. We refer back to
    these worksheets throughout the program so we recommend you upload them in
    Slack.
